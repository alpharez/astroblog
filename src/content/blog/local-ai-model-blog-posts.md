Understanding Local AI Models:
Local AI models, like Dolphin, are designed for deployment on local devices or servers within an organization's infrastructure. Unlike cloud-based
solutions, these models operate offline, offering enhanced data privacy and reduced latency. This allows businesses and individuals alike to harness
the power of AI without relying heavily on external services.

This post was written using the Dolphin3.0-Llama3.1-8B-F16.gguf model downloaded from HuggingFace with the prompt "write a tech blog post about using local AI models like Dolphin to write blog posts."  I used ollama to run the model locally on my desktop PC.
